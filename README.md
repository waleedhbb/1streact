cpsReact is a Click Per Second (CPS) test web application built using React. The app allows users to test their clicking speed within a set time, with options to choose between different time intervals (5 seconds, 10 seconds, 1 minute) and reset the timer. The user is prompted to click a button as many times as possible during the given time frame, and the app calculates and displays their CPS (Clicks Per Second) score. The app also includes a reset feature and is deployed to GitHub Pages for easy online access.
